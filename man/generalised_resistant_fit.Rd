\usage{
generalised_resistant_fit(
  lm_array,
  scale = TRUE,
  robust = FALSE,
  tolerance_limit = 0.005,
  projection = c("orthogonal", "stereographic")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lm_array}{A (num_landmark x num_dimension x num_individuals) array (or tensor) containing
raw landmark coordinates}

\item{scale}{A boolean value indicating whether analyses should be performed in
shape (scale = TRUE) or form (scale = FALSE) space.}

\item{robust}{A boolean value indicating whether a robust statistics should be used.}

\item{tolerance_limit}{A numeric value defining the tolerance acceptable for
algorithm convergence}

\item{projection}{Either select "orthogonal" or "stereographic" for this parameter.
This defines whether Procrustes coordinates are projected into tanjent space
using an orthogonal or stereographic projection.}
}
\value{
The superimposed Procrustes coordinates
}
\description{
The present function performs a full Generalised Resistant Analysis for the
registration of landmark configurations into a superimposed configuration.
This function by default performs superimposition using translation, rotation,
and scaling (shape analysis), however has also been adapted for analyses without
scaling (form analysis).
}
\section{Details}{

This function calculates a full Generalised Resistant fit on a set of 2D or 3D landmark
coordinates. The final product is a set of projected superimposed coordinates. GRF
was developed as a means of reducing the effect a single landmark may have on the
entire configuration (Siegel and Benson, 1982; Siegel and Pinkerton, 1982;
Rohlf and Slice, 1990; Slice, 1996; Dryden and Walker, 1999). Nevertheless,
this method is computationally expensive,
and in some cases do not guarantee convergence.
}

\section{Note}{


This is only an experimental function, we recommend using traditional GPA.

If this function produces an error, it will be due to a lack of convergence
in the algorithm.
